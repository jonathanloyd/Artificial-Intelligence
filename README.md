Projects for CSE545 (Artificial Intelligence)

All Projects were solo projects other than Project 6, which was a group project with Caty Battjes and Nicole Hartman.

Project 1 is Brute force for the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). 

Project 2 is Breadth First Search (BFS) and Depth First Search (DFS) for TSP. 

Project 3 is a Greedy algorithm for TSP which tries to find the node that is closest to an edge already in the tour.

Project 4 is Genetic Algorithm (GA) on TSP. 

Project 5 is GA with Wisdom of Crowds (WoC) on TSP. 

Project 6 is GA with WoC on Number Partitioning (group project). 

  CreateData.py is used to generate data for testing Project 6.
